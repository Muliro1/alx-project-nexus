# Security Checklist for Polling System API

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- [x] Token-based authentication
- [x] Password strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit)
- [x] Username validation (alphanumeric + underscore only)
- [x] Email validation for registration
- [x] Proper permission classes on views

### 2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- [x] Input length limits
- [x] Character sanitization (removing < > " ')
- [x] Poll expiration validation
- [x] Option uniqueness validation
- [x] Vote validation (no expired polls)

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- [x] Anonymous users: 100/hour
- [x] Authenticated users: 1000/hour
- [x] Burst protection: 60/minute

### 4. **Security Headers**
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] HSTS headers (production)
- [x] Content Security Policy

### 5. **Environment Security**
- [x] SECRET_KEY from environment variables
- [x] DEBUG mode configurable
- [x] ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration
- [x] HTTPS settings for production

### 6. **CORS Configuration**
- [x] Configurable CORS origins
- [x] Restricted HTTP methods
- [x] Restricted headers
- [x] Credentials support

## üîß Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. **Database Security**
- [ ] Use connection pooling
- [ ] Implement database-level constraints
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest

### 2. **Monitoring & Logging**
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Monitor failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Log all API access

### 3. **Advanced Security Features**
- [ ] Implement JWT tokens with expiration
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA for registration

### 4. **API Security**
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add request/response signing
- [ ] Implement API key rotation
- [ ] Add request size limits

### 5. **Infrastructure Security**
- [ ] Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Implement DDoS protection
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup encryption

## üö® Security Best Practices

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
   DEBUG=False
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com
   SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
   ```

2. **Database security:**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict database access by IP
   - Enable SSL connections

3. **Server security:**
   - Keep systems updated
   - Use HTTPS only
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Regular security scans

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for failed logins
   - Monitor API usage patterns
   - Log security events
   - Regular penetration testing

## üîç Security Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Test SQL injection on all inputs
- [ ] Test XSS on user inputs
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Test input validation
- [ ] Test authorization bypass

### Automated Testing:
- [ ] Set up security scanning tools
- [ ] Implement automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Code security analysis

## üìã Regular Security Tasks

### Weekly:
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Check for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Update dependencies

### Monthly:
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Review user permissions
- [ ] Backup security testing

### Quarterly:
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security training for team
- [ ] Update security policies
